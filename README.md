# Phase 1
- review the scenario description we've provided
- translate the requirements that you've identified into an (Enhanced/Extended) Entity-Relationship Diagram (EERD).  

# Phase 2
- Translate the given EERD into a set of relational schema 
- Translate the relational schema into create table statements with the appropriate data types, primary and unique keys, and foreign keys 
- Write insert statements to import the initial data into the tables you've created 
- Document all unhandled constraints based on your design & implementation choices 

# Phase 3
- Implement 19 stored procedures which allow the system operators to modify the database state in 
accordance with the main use case (i.e., managing bank accounts and assets)   
- Implement 5 views which provide information to the system operators about the database state from 
various "points of view" (i.e., system operator roles) 

# Phase 4 (optional)
