-- Team Member Name (GT username)
-- Team Member Name (GT username)

-- Directions:
-- Please follow all instructions for Phase II as listed on Canvas.
-- Fill in the team number and names and GT usernames for all members above.
-- Create Table statements must be manually written, NOT taken from an SQL Dump file.
-- The file must run without error to receive any credit.

-- Recommendations:
-- You may arrange your create table() and insert() statements in any order.
-- Develop a "strategy" to determine the order in which you will implement the tables.
-- Then, implement each table, and ensure that you can load the data correctly before
-- beginning work on the next table.
